# **ABOUT KUBERNETES**
Kubernetes is the open-source orchestrator which is used to create, manage and deploy containerized applications (microservices). It supports container APIs with quick shipping and scaling with decoupled architecture. It acts as a self-service platform that creates a hardware abstraction layer for the development team. Thereby, they can quickly access the resources as well as can handle the additional load.
