# **ABOUT DOCKER**
This open-source containerization platform is based on Linux that is useful for programmers to design, develop and run the package applications for deployment using containers. Basically, it divides the application’s performance into various components which able to process independently when needed. Docker containers offer efficient development and test, quick execution, interoperability, and more. With the docker environment, the applications/services can run with individual host access.

**_WHY ONE SHOULD LEARN MICROSERVICE, DOCKER, AND KUBERNETES?_**  
We have noticed that technologies today have evolved a lot to suit the requirements of today's needs of customers and projects. So that monolithic architectures are replaced with microservices and docker/Kubernetes open-source platforms.

## **Introduction to Containerization and Docker**
**Understanding VM's and Containers.**
  - Virtual machines and Containers are two ways of deploying multiple, isolated services on a single platform. Both VMs and containers use virtualization.
  - What Is Virtualization?
    - Virtualization is the process of creating a simulated computing environment that’s abstracted from the physical computing hardware—essentially a computer-generated computer. Virtualization allows you to create multiple, virtual computing instances from the hardware and software components of a single machine.
  - What Is a Hypervisor?
    - The software that enables virtualization is called a hypervisor. It’s a lightweight software layer that sits between the physical hardware and the virtualized environments and allows multiple operating systems (OS) to run in tandem on the same hardware.
  - What Are Virtual Machines?
    - The computer-generated computers that virtualization makes possible are known as virtual machines (VMs)—separate computers running on hardware that is actually contained in one physical computer.
    - Each VM requires its own OS. The OS and any applications running on an individual VM share hardware resources from a single host server. VM is isolated from its neighbors.
    - VMs, however, can take up a lot of system resources. Each VM runs not just a full copy of an OS, but a virtual copy of all the hardware that the operating system needs to run. It’s why VMs are sometimes associated with the term “monolithic”—they’re single, all-in-one units commonly used to run applications built as single, large files.
  - What Are Containers?
    - With containers, instead of virtualizing the underlying computer like a VM, just the OS is virtualized.
    - Containers sit on top of a physical server and its host OS—typically Linux or Windows. Each container shares the host OS kernel and, usually, the binaries and libraries, too. Containers are thus exceptionally light—they are only megabytes in size and take just seconds to start.
    - With containers, applications could be broken down into their smallest component parts or “services” that serve a single purpose, and those services could be developed and deployed independently of each other instead of in one monolithic unit.
