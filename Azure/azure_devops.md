For an **account** you can have **mutiple organizations** in it. e.g. Like a Company account will have multiple **organizations for HR, Account, Softwares,etc**. 
In the organization settings you can manage **Projects, Users, Billing, Policies, Permissions and other settings for suites**.
Projects are inside an Organization. You can multiple projects in one organization.

**For now we have used the Azure Devops Demo Generator**

To add **Users** , we need to add them **first** to the **Organization**. And **then** to the **projects**.
While adding users at organizational level we can decide the **Access Level** for them like **Basic, Stakeholder,VS Subscriber**.
Basic Users have access to most of the features. **Stakeholders** have ability to **add workitems**.
