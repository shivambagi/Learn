# **AZURE SERVICES**
## **Azure Compute Services**
Azure compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications. It provides computing resources such as disks, processors, memory, networking, and operating systems.
- **_Most prominent Azure compute services_**
    - VMs
        - IaaS
        - Simulate computers with an OS already installed
        - Everything but the hardware is customizable
        - VM scale sets: a set of identical, load-balanced VMs
    - Containers and Kubernetes
        - Container Instances and Azure Kubernetes Service are Azure compute resources that you can use to deploy and manage containers. Containers are lightweight, virtualized application environments.
        - You can run multiple on a single VM
        - They are virtualized application environments that are set up to run a specific app
        - They are designed to quickly replicate settings for multiple app instances
    - App services
        - PaaS e.g. Web,mobile,API
        - The platform that the app is running on is managed for you
    - Azure functions (for serverless computing)
        - If you just want your code to run, make it an Azure function
        - You don't care about the underlying platform or infrastructure

- **_When to use VMs_**
    - Custom hosting configurations
    - Custom software running on VM
    - You need to update, configure and maintain the software running on the VM
    - You can select a preconfigured VM image
    - Examples of when to use VMs
        - use for testing your app on different OSs
        - when running applications on VMs you can easily add/remove VMs as demand increases/decreases
        - when extending an on-premise network
        - during disaster recovery you can use VMs to pick up the slack
    - Lift and Shift: the process of moving from a physical server to the cloud
        - you can just make an image of the existing server and run that image on a VM
    - Azure batch
        - this is for running large-scale parallel and high-performance computing jobs
        - batch will spin up a pool of VMs, install the necessary apps and data, runs the jobs and then scales down as the work completes
- **_When to use an app service_**
    - You can host web apps, background jobs, mobile backends and REST APIs
    - You don't have to configure the environment
    - Azure takes care of scaling
    - Continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub or any Git repo
    - Endpoints can be secured
    - Hosts web apps using ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP or Python on either Windows or Linux
    - API apps have Swagger support
    - WebJobs often run background tasks for your app
    - Mobile app: store data, authenticate users, send notifications, execute backend logic
- **_When to use a container/Kubernetes service_**
    - Containers allow you to run multiple instances of an app on the same VM
    - Each container can run your app with different configurations (even a different OS)
    - Containers are managed by a container orchestrator
    - Manage containers with
        - Azure container instances
            - PaaS
            - you upload containers and it runs them
        - Azure Kubernetes service
            - for large volumes of containers
            - is an orchestration service
            - it can update containers
            - it can move them to different VMs
            - it can restart failed containers
            - it can manage networking and storage (even sharing data between containers)
    - Containers are used to create a microservice architecture
        - each service runs on its own container
        - each container can run a completely different environment that best suits the developers and the purpose of the microservice
        - updates to one microservice don't have to affect the other services
- **_When to use an Azure function_**
    - Good for event driven logic, i.e. it's usually waiting for input
    - Serverless: the infrastructure isn't your responsibility
    - Event triggers: timers, HTTP requests, queues, etc.
    - Micro-billing: you only pay for the time your function spends actually running
    - Azure functions:
        - can be written in almost any language
        - stateless: behave as if it's restarted every time
        - stateful (durable function): a context is passed into the function to track prior activity
        - you can redeploy the function into a non-serverless environment if the need arises
        - can run locally or in the cloud
    - Azure logic apps
        - built with predefined logic blocks in a graphical web-based editor
        - meant for executing workflows
        - predefined logic blocks exist to integrate with many popular services
        - you can write your own custom connectors
        - runs only in the cloud
- **_When to use a virtual desktop_**
    - You can access a cloud-hosted version of Windows from pretty much any device
    - You can protect your data because the user can't leave your files on their personal device since the environment is virtual
    - You can pick to host the VDs near your data centers to reduce load times
    - You can make VDs persistent, e.g. for remote employees
    - User profile appears on the device like a native user
    - Load balancing users on your host VM pools (the VMs the desktops are running on)
        - breadth mode: on login, users are spread out across VMs
        - depth mode: users are logged into one VM until it is full then new logins are directed to the next VM
    - If you own a Microsoft 365 or Windows license, you get Windows 10 and 7 desktops and apps for free


## **Azure Networking Services**
- **_What is Azure virtual networking?_**
Azure virtual networks enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers. 
    - _Key capabilities_
        - Isolation/Segmentation
            - You can create multiple isolated virtual networks (vnets)
            - You can define a private IP address space
            - You can divide the IP addresses into subnets for different parts of the network
        - Internet communications
            - A VM can access the internet by default
        - Communicate between Azure resources
            - Virtual networks: can connect together Azure resources, even VM scale sets
            - Service endpoints: you use these to access data resources
        - Communicate with on-premise resources
            - Point-to-Site: a computer outside your network connects to your Azure VPN
            - Site-to-Site: links your on-premises VPN to your Azure VPN, your Azure devices act like they're on your local network
            - Azure ExpressRoute: provides a dedicated private connection that doesn't travel over the internet, for high security and high bandwidth traffic
        - Route Network traffic
            - You can create custom routing tables for the subnets on your VPN
            - Border gateway protocol (BGP) works with Azure VPN gateways or ExpressRoute to link on-premises BGP routes to Azure virtual networks
        - Filter traffic
            - Network security group: an Azure resource that can contain inbound and outbound security rules (based on protocol, IP address, port, destination, etc.)
            - Network virtual appliances: a VM that can be configured like a network appliance, it can run a firewall, optimize WAN connections, etc.
        - Connect virtual networks
            - Connect vnets with network peering
            - Peering is what enables vnets to talk to each other
            - User defined routing (UDR): user can control routing tables between vnets and between subnets in each network
- **_Azure Virtual Network Settings_**
    - You can create a vnet from the Azure portal, using the Azure cloud shell or using Azure PowerShell on your local computer
    - Things you set when you create a vnet: which resource group it belongs to, location, multiple subnets, DDoS protection, service endpoints, address space (in classless interdomain routing (CIDR) format)
    - Additional settings: network security group to define security rules for each subnet, custom routing tables, create peering arrangements to connect vnets
    - You can create an automation script to generate a created vnet
- **_Azure VPN Gateway Fundamentals_**
    - Gateways are deployed in an Azure vnet
    - They enable site-to-site, point-to-site and network-to-network connectivity
    - All data is encrypted when it passes through untrusted networks
    - Azure VPN gateways use pre-shared key authentication
    - Internet key exchange (IKE) version 1 or 2 sets up the security agreement between the two endpoints, and the IPSec suite encrypts/decrypts the data
    - VPN gateway types
        - policy-based: user specifies which static IP addresses should be encrypted, IKEv1 only
        - route-based: source/destination networks aren't statically defined and instead routing tables are dynamically generated, used to connect vnets
    - You need these things before you can deploy a gateway
        - vnet
        - GatewaySubnet
        - public IP address
        - local network gateway
        - vnet gateway (can either be a VPN or ExpressRoute gateway)
        - connection resource (to connect the VPN gateway and the local network gateway)
    - An Azure VPN gateway has an active and a standby instance, the standby instance takes over for the active one if necessary
        - you can also deploy a VPN in an active/active state if you need higher availability
    - You can use an Azure VPN gateway to act as a failsafe for an ExpressRoute gateway
- **_Azure ExpressRoute fundamentals_**
    - You use this to establish a connection between your on-premise networks and Azure/Microsoft services without going over any public networks
    - Doesn't encryp data though
    - Open systems interconnection (OSI) model
        - layer 2: data link layer, node-to-node where the nodes are on the same network
        - layer 3: network layer, addressing and routing between nodes on a multi-node network
    - Benefits of ExpressRoute
        - layer 3 connectivity between on-premise and Microsoft networks
        - global connectivity available
        - dynamic routing between you and Microsoft via BGP
        - high reliability with built-in redundancy
    - ExpressRoute global reach
        - connect your networks via two ExpressRoute circuits, one at each location
        - cross traffic will travel through the Microsoft network
    - ExpressRoute connectivity models
        - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84464752/195976737-5545e985-4215-4ec0-ba25-a15c437e5fc6.png)
        - colocation: if you're near an internet provider you can request that they connect you directly to Microsoft
        - point-to-point Ethernet: connect your network directly to a Microsoft datacenter via Ethernet
        - any-to-any: Azure can link into your WAN and act as a part of your network

## **Azure Storage Services**
- Azure Storage is used to store many kinds of files, including files, messages, tables
- **_Types of storage_**
    - Blob storage: for images, videos, documents, etc.
      - unstructured, meaning you can store whatever you want on there
      - used for massive amounts of data
      - it can handle thousands of simultaneous uploads
      - organize blobs with containers
    - File storage: file sharing in the cloud, like connecting to shared folder on your computer
      - accessible via server message block and network file system
      - any number of Azure VMs can connect to the file storage share
      - it mounts to a computer like any networked disk
    - Disk storage: for you VMs to connect to, similar to accessing on-premises disks, solid and conventional drives available
      - provides disk storage for VMs
      - the disks act as if they were physically connected to the VM (the VM, in turn, acting like a physical computer)
      - hard disk drives or solid state drives
    - Table storage: no SQL, store semi-structured data for cheap
    - Queue storage: message queuing for communicating between app components
- **_Storage Tiers_**: hot (frequent access), cool (infrequent access, stored for at least 30 days), archive (long-term data, stored for at least 180 days)
- **_Blob Access Tiers_**
    - To save on costs, organize your data based on access frequency and retention period
    - Access tiers
        - hot: optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently
        - cool: for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (e.g. customer invoices)
        - archive: for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days (e.g. long-term backups)

## **Azure Database and Analytics Services**
- Azure offers relational, NoSQL and in-memory DBs
- Scalability, Security and Availability is automated
- **_Azure Cosmos DB_**
    - supports schema-less data
    - great for constantly changing data
    - at the lowest level Cosmos DB stores data in atom-record-sequence format
    - the data is then projected as an API which you specify
        - choices include MongoDB, SQL, Cassandra, Tables and Gremlin
        - in this case, I guess "API" is referring to the method/syntax/language with which the data is accessed?
- **_Azure SQL DB_**
    - relational DB based on the latest version of Microsoft SQL Server engine
    - no need to manage infrastructure, just build your apps that access the data
    - it's a PaaS
    - 99.99% availability
    - has built-in backups
    - allows storage of relational and non-relational data
    - you get the perks of SQL Server, including in-memory tech and intelligent query processing
    - Azure makes it easy to migrate your DB to the cloud using their Migration Assistant
    - after migrating, you just have to change your DB connection strings and you're set!
- **_Azure DB for MySQL_**
- **_Azure DB for PostgreSQL_**
- **_Azure SQL managed instance_**
    - PaaS DB engine, so it's a fully-managed environment
    - 99.99% uptime SLA
    - automated backup and configurable backup retention periods
    - example of when you'd want a SQL managed instance: your DB uses Cyrillic characters so the data can't be stored in an Azure SQL DB
- **_Big Data and Analytics_**
    - _Azure Synapse Analytics_
        - limitless analytics service
