## **Azure Compute Services**
Azure compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications. It provides computing resources such as disks, processors, memory, networking, and operating systems.
- **_Most prominent Azure compute services_**
    - VMs
        - IaaS
        - Simulate computers with an OS already installed
        - Everything but the hardware is customizable
        - VM scale sets: a set of identical, load-balanced VMs
    - Containers and Kubernetes
        - Container Instances and Azure Kubernetes Service are Azure compute resources that you can use to deploy and manage containers. Containers are lightweight, virtualized application environments.
        - You can run multiple on a single VM
        - They are virtualized application environments that are set up to run a specific app
        - They are designed to quickly replicate settings for multiple app instances
    - App services
        - PaaS e.g. Web,mobile,API
        - The platform that the app is running on is managed for you
    - Azure functions (for serverless computing)
        - If you just want your code to run, make it an Azure function
        - You don't care about the underlying platform or infrastructure
