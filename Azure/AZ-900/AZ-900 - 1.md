**_How does Azure work?_**
   - it does virtualization by using something called a hypervisor
     - the hypervisor runs multiple VMs on each server
     - one server in each rack runs a "fabric controller"
     - and each fabric controller is connected to the orchestrator
       - the orchestrator manages everything to do with the servers, including responding to user requests
       - requests are made through the Azure API, which can be accessed many ways, including through the Azure Portal
       - when a fabric controller gets a request from the orchestrator, it creates the VM, does something on the VM, whatever the user requested

**_What is Azure Portal?_**
   - Azure Portal is the GUI version of the Azure API

**_Azure services categories_**
   - _compute_: VMs, deployed apps
     - e.g. Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service
   - _networking_: VPN, load-balancing
     - e.g. Azure Virtual Network, Azure Load Balancer, Azure Application Gateway
   - _storage_: disk, file, blob and archival storage types
     - e.g. Azure Blob storage, Azure File storage
   - _mobile_: cross-platform/native devices, send notifications, etc.
   - _DBs_: various DB services
     - e.g. Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database
   - _web_: Azure Maps for geo services, publish APIs, etc.
     - e.g. Azure App Service-Quickly create powerful cloud web-based apps, Azure API Management-Publish APIs to developers, partners, and employees securely and at scale.
   - _IoT_: connect tons of different IoT devices, analyze sensor data
   - _big data_: open source cluster services help do analysis
   - _AI_: use your data to forecast
   - _devops_: automating software delivery

**_what is Azure Marketplace?_**
   - on Azure Marketplace you can install services to run on Azure
   - examples: all sorts of DBs, OS images, blockchain workbenches and dev kits

**_Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use? Why should I move to the cloud?_**
   - Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use. To put it another way, cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's datacenter.
   - Teams deliver new features to their users at record speeds.

# **DISCUSS AZURE FUNDAMENTALS CONCEPTS**

**_Different types of cloud models_**
   - public, private and hybrid clouds
     - public: services offered over the public internet
     - private: these are the services that are only used by the owners of the resources
     - hybrid: a cloud that has both private and public resources and allows data to be shared between them

**_Cloud model comparison_**
   - _public_:
     - organizations pay only for what they use
     - no capital expenditures to scale up (see capEx/opEx below)
     - applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
   - _private_:
     - hardware must be purchased at startup and for maintenance
     - organizations have complete control
     - organizations are solely responsible for maintenance/security
   - _hybrid_:
     - most flexible of the models
     - organizations decide where to run their applications
     - organizations control security/compliance

**_Cloud computing advantages_**
   - no apparent downtime for the user (how do they do that?)
   - easily scale vertically (increase processing power on individual machines) and horizontally (add capacity such as additional VMs)
   - scale up or down as needed so you only pay for what you use
   - deploy quickly as requirements change
   - distribute deployments across the world to get the best performance everywhere
   - backup services and data replication
**_capital expenses vs. operating expenses_**
   - capEx: the up-front costs of physical infrastructure, these assets depreciate over time
   - opEx: cost you pay as you use the services/products (consumption-based model), recurring payments
   - cloud services are opEx, users only pay for the resources that they use
   - opEx benefits:
     - has no upfront costs
     - no need to pay for maintenance or infrastructure that might go unused
     - pay only for what you use
     - stop paying for what you don't use

**_Cloud service models_**
   - SaaS services -> PaaS services -> IaaS services
   - IaaS (infrastructure as a service): closest to managing physical servers, the cloud provider only keeps the hardware up to date, operating system and network configuration is up to the user
   - PaaS (platform as a service): one step up from IaaS, the software as well as hardware requirements for running an app are taken care of by the provider, the user just has to upload code
   - SaaS (software as a service): the software is provided on top of everything else, e.g. Office 365
   - disadvantages
     - Paas: the hardware might have limitations and the user can't customize
     - SaaS: the hardware might not satisfy all the user's requirements, and the software itself might not either, no customization available

   - serverless computing
     - the developers don't deal with the actual running of their app on a server, a provider runs the server for them

# **Describe core Azure architectural components**

**_Overview of Azure subscriptions, management groups, and resources_**
| management groups | subscriptions | resource groups | resources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| manage access, policy, etc. for multiple subscriptions | groups user accounts | resources grouped together, say by app | VMs,DBs |

**_Azure regions, availability zones, region pairs_**
   - _Regions_
     - A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one but potentially multiple datacenters
     - Azure balances workloads in each region so that each region can serve its users as quickly as possible
     - each resource gets deployed to a specific region, and the VM where that resource lives will be within that region
   - _Availability zones_
     - physically separate data centers in a region
     - the idea is that at least one center in each zone will be running at any one time
     - not all regions support availability zones
     - you can replicate resources in multiple zones to provide redundency
     - services that support zones
       - zonal services (pin resource to a zone)
         - VMs, IP addresses, managed disks
       - zone-redundant services (replicates automatically across zones)
         - storage, SQL DBs
   - _Region pairs_
       - each region is paired with another region at least 300 miles away
       - the resources in each region are replicated in the other in case something wipes out the other region
       - some Azure services offer automatic geo-redundant storage with region pairs

**_Resource groups_**
   - Usually a group holds resources that are of the same type, related to the same app or all in the same region
   - A resource can only be a member of one group
   - Deleting a resource group deletes all the resources in it
   - You can apply role-based access control (RBAC) to a resource group

**_Resource manager_**
   - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84464752/195974593-c8dd513c-90d5-4c78-ab30-ca80c6a91d90.png)
   - With resource manager you can deploy/redeploy resources with templates to ensure deployments are consistent
   - You can define dependencies between resources
   - You can apply tags to resources

**_Subscriptions_**
   - Each user/account can have multiple subscriptions, each with different resource groups, permissions, etc.
   - Subscriptions can separate dev environments (testing, development, etc.)
   - Subscriptions can separate organizational structures, departments
   - Subscriptions can separate different billing groups so costs can be tracked by groups
   - Some resources are limited to a certain number per subscription, so you might make additional subscriptions in order to make more of that resource

**_Billing_**
   - Subscriptions can be grouped together into invoice sections so you can see the cost of groups of subscriptions
   - Billing account -> billing profile -> invoice section -> subscription
   - Each billing profile has its own monthly invoice and payment method

**_Management Groups_**
   - Management groups are a level above subscriptions
   - Subscriptions automatically inherit the conditions/rules applied to the group
   - e.g., you can make a rule for a management group that resources can only be made in specific regions
   - A management group tree can be six levels deep, not including the root level or the subscription level

**_Azure Marketplace_**
   - Store for apps that are certified to run in Azure, made up of Azure resources
   - You can buy and then deploy your own "copies" of those apps
