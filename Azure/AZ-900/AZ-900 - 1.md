| Describe cloud concepts | 20-25% |
| Describe core Azure services | 15-20% |
| Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure | 10-15% |
| Describe general security and network security features | 10-15% |
| Describe identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features | 20-25% |
| Describe Microsoft cost management and Service Level Agreements | 10-15% |


**_How does Azure work?_**
   - it does virtualization by using something called a hypervisor
     - the hypervisor runs multiple VMs on each server
     - one server in each rack runs a "fabric controller"
     - and each fabric controller is connected to the orchestrator
       - the orchestrator manages everything to do with the servers, including responding to user requests
       - requests are made through the Azure API, which can be accessed many ways, including through the Azure Portal
       - when a fabric controller gets a request from the orchestrator, it creates the VM, does something on the VM, whatever the user requested

**_What is Azure Portal?_**
   - Azure Portal is the GUI version of the Azure API

**_Azure services categories_**
   - compute: VMs, deployed apps
   - networking: VPN, load-balancing
   - storage: disk, file, blob and archival storage types
   - mobile: cross-platform/native devices, send notifications, etc.
   - DBs: various DB services
   - web: Azure Maps for geo services, publish APIs, etc.
   - IoT: connect tons of different IoT devices, analyze sensor data
   - big data: open source cluster services help do analysis
   - AI: use your data to forecast
   - devops: automating software delivery

**_what is Azure Marketplace?_**
   - on Azure Marketplace you can install services to run on Azure
   - examples: all sorts of DBs, OS images, blockchain workbenches and dev kits

**_Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use? Why should I move to the cloud?_**
   - Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use. To put it another way, cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's datacenter.
   - Teams deliver new features to their users at record speeds.
