# **Part 4: Describe general security and network security features**
## **_Protect against security threats on Azure_**
- Azure Security Center
    - It shows you how secure you are for both your Azure and on-premise services
    - Security posture
        - How well can you predict, prevent and respond to threats?
        - What cybersecurity policies and controls do you have in place?
    - Security Center can
        - Monitor all your security settings (Azure and on-prem)
        - Automatically apply security settings when a resource comes online
        - Provide security recommendations
        - Automatically identify potential vulnerabilities
        - Use ML to detect malware
        - Detect potential attacks
        - Provide just-in-time network port access
    - Dashboard view shows security health, compliance, reports, etc.
    - Cloud defense for VMs
        - just-in-time access to VMs
        - Control which apps can run on the VMs
        - Monitor network traffic
        - Monitor changes to important config files
    - You can set up workflows using Azure Logic Apps to respond to security threats
- Azure Sentinel
    - Aggregates sources of security info (security information and event management, SIEM)
    - Collect data from all users, devices, apps, infrastructure, both on-prem and cloud
    - Detect threats using Microsoft's analytics
    - Investigate threats with AI
    - Respond to threats rapidly
    - Connect to
        - Microsoft solution like Microsoft 365, Threat Protection, Azure Active Directory, Windows Defender Firewall
        - AWS CloudTrail, Citrix Analytics, VMWare Carbon Black Cloud, etc.
        - Sources that use Common Event Format (CEF) messaging, Syslog or REST
    - You can create custom analyzers to detect threats
    - When an incident occurs, the user can view an investigation graph that shows where/how the incident occurred
    - You can use Azure Monitor Playbooks to automate a response to a threat
- Azure Key Vault
    - Store app secrets in one cloud location
    - Manage secrets, encryption keys, SSL/TSL certificates or store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs)
    - Benefits
        - Centralized app secrets
        - Securely stored
        - Access monitoring and access control
        - Simplify administration of secrets
        - Integrate easily with other Azure services, like storage accounts, containers, event hubs, etc.
- Azure Dedicated Host
    - Host your VMs on a dedicated physical server
    - If you want to be the only Azure customer running on a server, you can get a dedicated server
    - A "dedicated host" is a physical server in an Azure datacenter
    - A "host group" is a collection of dedicated servers
    - Benefits
        - Helps with compliance requirements if you're required to not share hardware with other customers
        - Lets you choose server hardware details, like processors
        - You have more control over the infrastructure than with a regular VM
        - You can also control when maintenance updates occur (within a 35-day window)
    - You pay per dedicated host
