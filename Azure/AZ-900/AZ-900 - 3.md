# **Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure**
## **_Choose the best Azure IoT service for your application_**
- Managing IoT devices with Azure = IoT enables devices to gather and then relay information for data analysis. Smart devices are equipped with sensors that collect data.
    - Common measuring devices
        - weather info
        - bar codes, QR codes
        - geolocation
        - light, radar, ladar
        - sound, motion, smell
        - chemical sensors (smoke, gas, alcohol)
        - pressure
        - error detection
    - IoT devices such as ones that measure the above can collect data and send it to Azure
    - that aggregate data can be stored and processed by Azure services
        - you can predict when you'll need to do maintenance
        - you can know when you have to increase inventory
    - you can send updates to devices through Azure
    - Azure IoT Hub
        - two-way communication with your IoT devices
        - secure connections to millions of devices
        - mostly for transferring data
    - Azure IoT Central
        - like Hub but also offers a customizable dashboard
        - you can set up alerts to trigger when certain things happen to the devices
        - has monitoring and reporting capabilities that Hub doesn't
    - Azure Sphere
        - end-to-end security, from the device to Azure
        - comes with physical micro-controller unit
        - has built-in Linux OS to run security software
        - can detect if it's been compromised (Azure Sphere Security Service)
        - the device will only connect to Azure if the MCU decides it's safe
 - analyze decision criteria (how to choose which IoT service to use)
    - is it likely that devices get hacked and is it critical that they don't? (Azure Sphere)
    - do I need a dashboard to manage and report data? (Azure Central adds a dashboard on top of Azure Hub)
    - do I just need the data because I already have my own software to use the data? (Azure Hub)
