# **Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure**
## **_Choose the best Azure IoT service for your application_**
- Managing IoT devices with Azure = IoT enables devices to gather and then relay information for data analysis. Smart devices are equipped with sensors that collect data.
    - Common measuring devices
        - Weather info
        - Bar codes, QR codes
        - Geolocation
        - Light, radar, ladar
        - Sound, motion, smell
        - Chemical sensors (smoke, gas, alcohol)
        - Pressure
        - Error detection
    - IoT devices such as ones that measure the above can collect data and send it to Azure
    - That aggregate data can be stored and processed by Azure services
        - You can predict when you'll need to do maintenance
        - You can know when you have to increase inventory
    - You can send updates to devices through Azure
    - Azure IoT Hub

        - Secure connections to millions of devices
        - Mostly for transferring data
    - Azure IoT Central
        - Like Hub but also offers a customizable dashboard
        - You can set up alerts to trigger when certain things happen to the devices
        - Has monitoring and reporting capabilities that Hub doesn't
    - Azure Sphere
        - End-to-End security, from the device to Azure
        - Comes with physical micro-controller unit
        - Has built-in Linux OS to run security software
        - Can detect if it's been compromised (Azure Sphere Security Service)
        - The device will only connect to Azure if the MCU decides it's safe
 - Analyze Decision criteria (how to choose which IoT service to use)
    - Is it likely that devices get hacked and is it critical that they don't? (Azure Sphere)
    - Do I need a dashboard to manage and report data? (Azure Central adds a dashboard on top of Azure Hub)
    - Do I just need the data because I already have my own software to use the data? (Azure Hub)

## **_Choose the best AI service for your needs_**
- Product options
    - Deep learning algorithm: algorithm that is structured like the human brain, with neurons, enabling it to grow and learn from data
    - Machine learning algorithm: data model is trained with data and then used to predict results for new data
    - Azure Machine Learning
        - Set up process for obtaining, cleaning and splitting data
        - Train and evaluate models
        - Define where and when training should occur (since it's computationally intensive and shouldn't be run anywhere, anytime)
        - Deploy the best algorithms for use
    - Azure Cognitive Services
        - You don't need to know about machine learning to use this service
        - Provides prebuilt ML models
        - They solve general problems with
            - language
            - speech
            - vision
            - decision-making
    - Azure Bot Service
        - For creating a bot that acts like a human
        - Meant to automate simple or repetitive tasks
- Analyze the decision criteria
    - Are you building a virtual agent to interface with humans using natural language?
        - use Bot Service
        - there are pre-built Bots on Azure Marketplace
    - Do you need a service to understand media such as text, sound, images, etc?
        - Cognitive Services will solve common problems that have already been solved with ML
        - it works with common media data types (text, video, speech, images, etc.)
    - Do you need to make predictions or provide personalized recommendations?
        - Cognitive Services has a Personalizer component to do this
        - You could also train your own models with Azure ML Service
    - Do you have custom/personal data you want to make predictions with?
        - You can use Azure ML Service to create, test and deploy your own models

## **_Choose the best Azure serverless technology for your business scenario_**
- Serverless computing: an execution environment is set up and managed for you
- You write the code and Azure deploys, runs and scales it
- Primarily for back-end services like reacting to events triggered by REST endpoints or a timer
- Azure Functions
    - Event driven
    - You have to code the functions yourself
    - Can be a single method or function coded in C#, Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Java, and PowerShell
    - Azure Functions are stateless (but you could hook them up to an Azure storage account if you need to save state)
    - When you care about the code and not the infrastructure it's running on
- Azure Logic Apps
    - Use when you need to respond to events
    - Low-code / no-code development using Logic Apps Designer
    - Use when demand is variable
- What are the differences between these services?
    - You can call Azure Functions from Azure Logic Apps, and vice versa. The primary difference between the two services is their intent. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, and Azure Logic Apps is intended to be a serverless orchestration service.
- Analyze the decision criteria
    - Do you need to perform an orchestration across APIs?
        - Lots of common connectors are already built for Azure Logic Apps
        - You can create your own if necessary
        - Otherwise, just drag and drop graphical code blocks to create the app
    - Do you need to run custom algorithms or specialized data parsing or lookups?
        - For specialized cases you'll want to use Azure Functions so you can write your own code
    - Do you have existing automated tasks already written?
        - If your functions are already written then you can use Azure Functions to deploy them straight to Azure
    - Do you prefer visual/declarative or written/imperative coding?
        - Azure Functions is for written code
        - You "write" Logic apps with a graphical interface

## **_Choose the best tools to help organizations build better solutions_**
- The role of DevOps is to automate ongoing development so that software can be tested and released quickly
- Some parts of DevOps: source-code management, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), automating testing environments
- Azure DevOps Services
    - Azure Repos - Store repos
    - Azure Boards - Use task boards and reporting tools to organize work
    - Azure Pipelines - CI/CD pipeline automation
    - Azure Artifacts - is a repository to Host artifacts, like compiled source code, for feeding into deployment of testing pipeline steps
    - Azure Test Plans - Automated test tool
- GitHub and GitHub Actions
    - Great for open-source
    - Can automate a CI/CD toolchain
        - a toolchain is a combo of software tools that work to deliver, deploy and manage apps
        - output of one step in the chain is the input to the next
        - things done in toolchain: automated dependency updates, build/configure software, build artifacts, run tests, etc.
        - lighter weight than Azure DevOps, is more public, geared for individual developers
- Azure DevTest Labs
    - Builds, sets up and tears down VMs used to test your software builds
    - Creates various environments for testing
    - Management can restrict how many environments can be built and how long they can run for
- Analyze the decision criteria
    - Automate test-lab creation? Azure DevTest
    - Building open-source software? GitHub
    - Need granular control over permissions? Azure DevOps
    - Do you need sophisticated project management and reporting? Azure DevOps
    - Do you need to integrate tightly with third-party tools? check which platform the third-party tool integrates with

## **_Choose the best tools for managing and configuring your Azure environment_**
- By using Azure management tools, administrators, developers, and managers can interact with the cloud environment to perform such tasks as:
  - Deploying dozens or hundreds of resources at a time.
  - Configuring individual services programmatically.
  - Viewing rich reports across usage, health, costs, and more.
- There are visual and code-based tools, and Azure provides both types
- Code that can be run to set up resources is called "infrastructure as code"
    - can either be imperative or declarative code
    - imperative code: details each step
    - declarative code: outlines the outcome and lets the interpreter decide how to reach the outcome
    - declarative code is best for when you want to deploy dozens or hundreds of resources at once
- Azure portal
    - you can access pretty much every Azure feature
    - has a UI interface
    - create, deploy, configure resources
    - view reports
- Azure mobile app
    - monitor status of resources
    - check for alerts, restart apps or VMs
    - run Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell commands
- Azure PowerShell
    - execute "cmdlets"
    - can create scripts
    - can do every management task in Azure
    - use imperative code/script to deploy and entire infrastructure
    - can be used through the Azure Cloud Shell or through PowerShell on any computer
    - you can transfer your PowerShell knowledge to using Azure
- Azure CLI
    - use Azure through a Bash shell
    - you can perform any possible Azure management task
    - can be accessed through any computer running Bash or through the Cloud Shell
- ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates
    - scripts that deploy lots of resources that depend on each other and probably need to be deployed/created in a certain order
    - written in JSON
    - the template is verified before running to make sure no mistakes were made
    - templates can execute Bash/PowerShell scripts before or after a resource has been set up
    - declarative, unlike Bash/PowerShell scripts
- Analyze the decision criteria
    - need to perform one-time management, admin or reporting actions? it's fastest to use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI (on desktop or on mobile)
    - need to set up resources and ensure dependencies are created in the right order? use an ARM template to ensure the template will create everything in the correct order BEFORE running the script
    - do you have Linux or Windows admin background? if Windows, you'd use Azure PowerShell; if Linux, you'd use Azure CLI (Bash)
