# **Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure**
## **_Choose the best Azure IoT service for your application_**
- Managing IoT devices with Azure = IoT enables devices to gather and then relay information for data analysis. Smart devices are equipped with sensors that collect data.
    - Common measuring devices
        - Weather info
        - Bar codes, QR codes
        - Geolocation
        - Light, radar, ladar
        - Sound, motion, smell
        - Chemical sensors (smoke, gas, alcohol)
        - Pressure
        - Error detection
    - IoT devices such as ones that measure the above can collect data and send it to Azure
    - That aggregate data can be stored and processed by Azure services
        - You can predict when you'll need to do maintenance
        - You can know when you have to increase inventory
    - You can send updates to devices through Azure
    - Azure IoT Hub
        - Two-way communication with your IoT devices
        - Secure connections to millions of devices
        - Mostly for transferring data
    - Azure IoT Central
        - Like Hub but also offers a customizable dashboard
        - You can set up alerts to trigger when certain things happen to the devices
        - Has monitoring and reporting capabilities that Hub doesn't
    - Azure Sphere
        - End-to-End security, from the device to Azure
        - Comes with physical micro-controller unit
        - Has built-in Linux OS to run security software
        - Can detect if it's been compromised (Azure Sphere Security Service)
        - The device will only connect to Azure if the MCU decides it's safe
 - Analyze Decision criteria (how to choose which IoT service to use)
    - Is it likely that devices get hacked and is it critical that they don't? (Azure Sphere)
    - Do I need a dashboard to manage and report data? (Azure Central adds a dashboard on top of Azure Hub)
    - Do I just need the data because I already have my own software to use the data? (Azure Hub)

## **_Choose the best AI service for your needs_**
- Product options
    - Deep learning algorithm: algorithm that is structured like the human brain, with neurons, enabling it to grow and learn from data
    - Machine learning algorithm: data model is trained with data and then used to predict results for new data
    - Azure Machine Learning
        - Set up process for obtaining, cleaning and splitting data
        - Train and evaluate models
        - Define where and when training should occur (since it's computationally intensive and shouldn't be run anywhere, anytime)
        - Deploy the best algorithms for use
    - Azure Cognitive Services
        - You don't need to know about machine learning to use this service
        - Provides prebuilt ML models
        - They solve general problems with
            - language
            - speech
            - vision
            - decision-making
    - Azure Bot Service
        - For creating a bot that acts like a human
        - Meant to automate simple or repetitive tasks
- Analyze the decision criteria
    - Are you building a virtual agent to interface with humans using natural language?
        - use Bot Service
        - there are pre-built Bots on Azure Marketplace
    - Do you need a service to understand media such as text, sound, images, etc?
        - Cognitive Services will solve common problems that have already been solved with ML
        - it works with common media data types (text, video, speech, images, etc.)
    - Do you need to make predictions or provide personalized recommendations?
        - Cognitive Services has a Personalizer component to do this
        - You could also train your own models with Azure ML Service
    - Do you have custom/personal data you want to make predictions with?
        - You can use Azure ML Service to create, test and deploy your own models
